    <p>
      This dataset combines <strong>names and details for persons and entities of
      interest</strong>. Such entities include political leaders as well as entities
      sanctioned by various governemnts (e.g. connected to criminal and
      terrorist activity), or those barred from public procurement.
    </p>
    <h3>Why would this be useful?</h3>
    <p>
      Let's say you are working as a journalist and you have received a leaked database,
      a document stash or a fresh open data release that you'd like to dig through. The
      next question is: what are you going to search for? This dataset gives a possible
      answer: by cross-referencing with sanctions lists and names of political leaders
      you can produce leads, which you can then check for political and criminal relevance.

    <h3>Can this dataset be used freely?</h3>
    <p>
      Hopefully. While care is taken not to violate commerical copyrights, databases
      included in this dataset might carry unexpected claims of copyright by the
      institutions which provide them. YMMV.

    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the database is distributed as a set of downloads which are updated
      regularly. In the future, I hope to also provide additional services, such as
      an OpenRefine Reconciliation API.
