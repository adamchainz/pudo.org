One of the first tasks I was given by Spiegel Online was to make a set of simple 
maps to display basic statistics about Germany - things like population, unemployment
or insolvencies. As Germany's statistical data are collected in a system called 
[GENESIS](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online), I though that this would
be trivial. I'd just have to write a script to grab the tables once a month, convert
them to JSON and thus update the maps.

Unfortunately, the strucutred tables offered by GENESIS are both hard to access 
(through an arcane and untested SOAP interface) and hard to parse. Essentially,
the tables are reports which have been manually composed, and getting out a specific
data point requires you to pretty much write a dedicated parser for each table.

So I decided to solve this issue properly and make [ReGENESIS](http://regenesis.pudo.org),
a toolkit for extracting clean and well-structured data from the German statistical
services. This was inspired by some great examples of similar projects other
countries: [Census.IRE.org](http://census.ire.org/) provides a lot of structured
data around the US census, and the [CensusReporter](http://censusreporter.tumblr.com/)
project is now thinking this through a lot further. I'm also really impressed by the work that [Brian](http://brianabelson.com/) and the [@csvsoundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com/) have
been doing on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io/), a convenient data source with a
ScraperWiki-based SQL query endpoint and client bindings for a variety of languages.
