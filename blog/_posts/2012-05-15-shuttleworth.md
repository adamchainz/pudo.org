title: Six months of open data - Shuttleworth Recap 
---

In November 2011, the Shuttleworth Foundation awarded me a so-called flash grant. 
Flash grants are an awesome idea: instead of a full fellowship, a smaller sum of 
money is given to people, with only the condition of reporting about their
activities to the world. Since I haven't been blogging very much about many of 
the projects in which I've been involved over the last few months, here's a small
recap. 

Soon after receiving the grant, I decided that I wanted to use this time to work
on two areas: promoting the idea of open government and open data in Germany and 
helping advocates and journalists to make sense of open data and to use it for their
purposes.

Open Data in Germany
--------------------

In Germany, things are either done very properly or not at all. Many options are 
considered, few are tried out. While adopting this attidude in opening up governemnt 
is not surprising for political actors, German geeks seem to be doing the same: 
instead of using their technical skills to create digital civic infrastructure, many
are now [running for office](http://piratenpartei.de). While this is an interesting development, it also means that there are few interesting open government initiatives.

As a demonstration of the kinds of tools needed, I spent a lot of time in October 
and January trying to to productize [OffenesParlament](http://offenesparlament.de), a legislative tracking site for the federal parliament. It allows citizens to easily 
search parliamentary business, speeches and to subscribe to updates about a specific 
topic or politician. The site has recently entered [entered its beta phase](http://okfn.de/2012/05/offenesparlament/) and we're now actively seeking more coders to help with 
further development.

But software along is not enough, so together with [fukami](http://foo.io) and the
support of various NGOs ([OKFN](http://okfn.de), [CCC](http://ccc.de), [Digitale Gesellschaft](http://digitalegesellschaft.de) and the [Open Data Network](http://opendata-network.org/)), I helped to organize a [series of hackdays](http://hackday.net/) across Germany, in [Hamburg](http://pudo.org/2012/01/16/hackday-hamburg.html), Berlin and Cologne.
The events helped to connect [different](http://www.hamburgmittedokumente.de/)
[data](http://fragdenstaat.de) [initiatives](http://offeneskoeln.de/), but attendance was low, showing a need for more professional organizing.

Based on these experiences of trying to grow the German community, we're currently 
in the planning stage of an open government incubator. Our goal is to raise a 
small fund which we can use to support civic hackers who want to initiate new
projects &mdash; an initiative that is obviously inspired by the flash grant.

Data as a tool for advocacy and journalism
------------------------------------------

As more and more open data becomes available, the question of how it can
effectively be used to inform public opinion becomes more salient. Two key 
groups in this, journalists and advocates, are often inexperienced in using
information technology &mdash; not to mention raw data. 

In late January, I was able to join the [African Media Initiative](http://www.africanmediainitiative.org/) and the World Bank Institute for a [three-day 
data journalism workshop](http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/news/2012/01/18/finding-story-open-budgets) in Nairobi, Kenya. As I'm writing this, I am on my way to Chisinau, Moldova, to 
contribute to [a similiar event](http://codd.md/) organized by the same groups.
Through the OKF, I also had the opportunity to participate in the [School of Data
Journalism](http://www.journalismfestival.com/) in Perugia, Italy, and 
[Data Harvest](http://www.wobbing.eu/news/data-harvest-conference-2012), a 
meeting of EU-focussed investigative reporters in Brussels. I was further able 
to lend a (web-designing) hand to the awesome team producing the [Data 
Journalism Handbook](http://ddjbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_3.html), a 
collection of texts about this emerging practice.

Although the external conditions of these events are very different, their goals 
are very similar. We're trying to establish a dialogue between journalists
and coders, the explore how data can be used to make better news. Our work there
is focissed on introducing journalists to new strategies and tools for information acquisition, processing and presentation. On the other hand, I have learnt a lot about investigating an issue and telling a story from the people I've met.

A recurring technical need articulated both by investigative journalists and 
NGOs hat I talked to was a tool for the [mapping of actor networks](http://pudo.org/2011/12/19/sna.html). Such a tool would allow its users to create a 
structured analysis of the relations between different companies, persons or 
organizations involved in a certain topic.

To explore this question, I teamed up with the [Corporate Europe Observatory](http://www.corporateeurope.org/), [LobbyControl](http://www.lobbycontrol.de/blog/) and 
[Friends of the Earth Europe](http://www.foeeurope.org/) to create a site 
around the European Union's lobby register. After creating a prototype 
discussion piece in December, a lot of data cleansing work lead into a second 
[demo version of the site](http://lobbydemo.pudo.org/) near the end of March.

The data work, however, proved not to be the most challenging part of the 
project. It became clear that defining how the information can best contribute 
to the campaigning goals of the organisations would be key to the site's 
development: What is the message? What are the key topics we want to focus on? 
We therefore decided to invite the [Tactical Technology Collective](http://tacticaltech.org/) to join the project and to use their experience in facilitating this design process.

The backend technology of the lobby register project, a software called 
[Grano](https://github.com/pudo/grano/blob/master/README.md),
is a re-usable service for actor and relationship mapping, which I hope to 
develop into a journalistic tool in the future. It could help to enable the 
evidence-driven analysis of power structures in an accessible way.

Bottom line
-----------

I tremendously enjoyed the freedom afforded by the flash grant. Defining your own
work turns out to be a hard job, but it is a fantastic way to explore a domain 
like open data. After taking on a new role as tech lead of 
[OpenSpending](http://openspending.org) in February, there was unfortunately less
time for me to work on independent projects. Still, I hope that some of the initiatives 
spawned over the last six months will evolve into useful tools and active communities. 

Many thanks, Mark!
