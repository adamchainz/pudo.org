title: Exploring the EU Transparency Register
---


In all, there are four different roles that an actor - such as an 
organisation, person or company - can have in the transparency 
register: 

* They can be registered directly, in one of the six categories.
* They can be listed as a member organization of one of the 
  registered groups. While some groups actually represent a 
  variety of different organisations, many (especially from 
  Germany, Austria and scandinavian Countries) have also listed
  a large number of almost identical local chapters or branches.
* A company or organization can be listed as a client of a 
  professional legal or lobbying company. This is stated as part 
  of the income statement of a representative, giving a monetary
  range within which the payments are bounded.
* Individuals can appear both in the two required roles
  stored in the register as head of the organization and legal 
  representative or as someone with a European Parliament 
  accreditation. 

While there are only about 4200 registered representatives in the
register, the total count of all mentioned actors is 51268 as 
of this week.
