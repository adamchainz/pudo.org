[SpenDB](https://github.com/pudo/spendb) is a prototype-stage, light-weight data loading tool and analytical API for government financial data. Over the past few months, I have spent my weekends simplifying and modernizing the OpenSpending codebase to create this tool.

So far, I've been able to make it easier for non-technical users to submit and model data, to introduce a more systematic process for data management (based on [loadkit](https://github.com/pudo/loadkit) and [archivekit](https://github.com/pudo/archivekit)) and to upgrade to a newer stack of technologies (Flask, Angular and Bootstrap 3).

## Simplifying the mammoth

The biggest conceptual change is the data loading process, which now accepts file uploads, stores all source and cleaned data on Amazon and changes the way that models are applied to the data so that the OLAP description of the data can be produced and changed after data loading is complete.

        SpenDB's data loader supports direct data uploads and a variety of source data formats 
        (including Excel, OpenOffice, CSV).

Beyond that, SpenDB uses Stefan Urbanek's excellent [Cubes](http://cubes.databrewery.org/) for its analytics API. The tool supports a richer set of query operations and has its own growing community. This change, and dropping many non-essential features, allowed the code to shrink down to a quarter of that in OpenSpending.

        Not there yet: the data modelling tool probably still has a mean learning curve, but it's already easier than OpenSpending's dimensions editor.

Two months into these changes, Open Knowledge [adopted](https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/openspending-dev/2015-February/001091.html) another strategy - now called [Next](http://labs.openspending.org/next/) - for the OpenSpending project. It is focussed on providing developers with a data catalogue and mirco-services, rather than producing a coherent, user-facing experience.

## Focus on usability and data analysis

While SpenDB may eventually find its place in OpenSpending Next, I want to focus my contributions on the issues underlying much of the user feedback I've seen in the last four years. This means making loading data into the platform incredibly easy, and providing meaningful ways to study the available budgets, expenditures and contract awards.

Thus far, SpenDB solves neither of these challenges, but it creates a great starting point: the new loading architecture makes it easy to iterate on the user experience for data submission, and the Cubes API will allow query and visualization tools to connect to both SpenDB and other Cubes-based projects, like [ReGENESIS](/blog/2013/08/08/regenesis.html) (German national statistics).

To test my work, I plan to migrate [OffenerHaushalt](http://offenerhaushalt.de/) to the new API, so that German budget cartographers can provide feedback on the data loading workflow. Once analytical tools are developed, the [European contract awards in OpenTED](http://ted.openspending.org/) and research funding in [Germany's FÃ¶rderkatalog](https://morph.io/pudo/foerderkatalog) will be great testing datasets for pivot tables and aggregate search functionality.

Eventually, I'm hoping to also produce a generalized version of Mark Brough's [Aid Budget Mapper](http://data.aidonbudget.org/), a tool for taxonomy alignment which provides the foundation for a [crowd-sourced budget comparison](https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/openspending-dev/2015-April/001126.html) initiative.

## Call for contributions

Hacking on SpenDB has been extremely fun and instructive, it's a microcosm of web-based business intelligence applications. Now that the core is relatively stable, the focus will shift towards user experience, design and making great data analysis tools.

For anyone who is looking for a cool data project to cut their teeth on, there is plenty to do here: 

* Build a great Cubes-based implementation of a **pivot tables-like data browser**.
* Generate, capture and reflect **user feedback for the data loading process**.
* Come up with a simple but useful way to **sift through datasets** and to make sure they are always up to date and complete.
* Design **beautiful bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, treemaps** and slope graphs.
* **Documentation** that is accessible, useful and detailed

Obviously, this list is a personal wish-list, but SpenDB should do whatever you think is needed to crack the nut of practical budget and fiscal transparency for a broader audience. Come hack!
