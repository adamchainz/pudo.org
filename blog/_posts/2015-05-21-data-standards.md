Developing open data standards is all the rage. IATI, EITI, OCDS, GTFS,
XBRL, SDMX, BDP, HDX - if your sector doesn't have a cryptic-sounding
data initiative yet, it probably will soon.

In fact, chances are that you're drawing one up right now (I am). In
that case, here's a list of things you may believe about your data
standard. They are probably not true:

* Policy and tech people on your team **mean the same thing** when they
  say *standard*. There is a magical and unbreakable bond between
  conventions for government policy and column naming schemes.

* **Different systems of government** will produce data that should be
  expressed in the same format. Everybody's mechanism for debating and
  making laws, or for handing out public contracts, or for managing 
  public funds is basically the same, right?

* **Standards are tools for publishing data.** Use cases can be derived
  from the data structure available in your in-house database. For end
  users, put 'researchers, journalists, NGOs'. Never put your own name
  there, your job is to *empower others*.

* Many **people will develop tools and platforms** to handle your data. You
  will not be stuck having to pay for your own *tools ecosystem* for the
  next fifteen years. The tools will actually work with data published
  by different sources.

* The **economics of standardization always work out**. This is true even
  when to date, nobody has been using the data (they will be able to do
  that more effectively now). When evaluating gains, think about Nairobi
  startups, not your own organisation.

* Your committee is the **centre of the known universe**. It is your duty to
  specify what countries exist in the world, what currencies they use and
  what constitutes a company. DublinCore is the maximum level of possible
  standards re-use.

* A standard is **the best way of publishing data**. Having a centralized
  API that actually works and has data quality assurance built in would
  be some sort of tech imperialism. The coordination cost of spreading
  data all over the web and collecting it upon use is lower.

* All **data analysis problems are global**. You need a standard before you
  can derive knowledge from data. As your data scales, the analytical
  questions people are working on will begin to apply to vastly
  different contexts. 

Have I missed any?
