title: A good social network analysis tool for advocacy & journalism
---

Some of the most interesting transparency and journalism-related
datasets are those in which the relations of various actors and
institutions are portrayed over time: [corporate ownership](http://opencorporates.com/), 
[lobbying](http://lobbypedia.de/) or [organized crime 
networks](http://www.reportingproject.net/)  all present similar
challenges. 

And yet there seems to be no good off-the-shelf package to display
such data. Sure, there are things like UCINet for classic SNA and 
[Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for graph data visualization. But I think 
they're inadequate. The gold standard for graph presentation in 2011
is not ``graphviz``, its Facebook. I don't mean to imply that 
networks need to be stored as massively centralized, ad-powered 
dotcoms, but there are a couple of lessons to learn:

* It needs to be fully web-based and not overtly about graph 
  management. Rich attributes for both nodes and edges need to be stored 
  and presented in a task-specific form.
* Some level of access control enables more interesting use cases.
* Network effects apply to networks. Ha.

The problem in building this is simple: **its a trap**. For any coder, 
our greatest dream is to transfer some new domain of knowledge into a
perfect graph (I'm guilty myself, having worked on [liquid democracy](http://wiki.liqd.net/Main_Page)). 
In this case, the temptation is almost irresistible: the data is already a 
network. 

Yet as we work to translate things into this graph, we tend to lose 
sight of the goal. A nice example of this is OWNI's
[InfluenceNetworks](http://influencenetworks.org/): while it is supposed to
be the the tool this whole post is about, they ended up just building a 
snazzy graph management app. Nice, but useless.

Even more dangerous: doing this internally. The linked data community 
seems to be crippled by *graph fever*. More than once have I sat through 
an hour-long presentation on the use of linked data in which no actual 
use for an end-user facing application was mentioned. While I'm not saying 
its impossible to build good applications on RDF, it seems like a huge
distraction from actually tackling the domain.

But the problem remains: **we need some easy-to-use solutions for
advocates, journalists and other investigators to map out networks**. The 
best effort towards this I've seen so far seems to be 
[andoc](https://github.com/endpnt/andoc), but even this does not feel
like it is hitting the right trade-off between abstract graphness and 
concrete modelling yet. But: how do we find that trade-off? Seems some 
conrecte use cases and a nice agile process is needed...
